KEY TO SOLUTIONS TO DATA MING COURSEWORK 2:

SOLUTION FOR QUESTION 1(Text Mining):
Text_Mining.py

SOLUTION FOR QUESTION 2(Image Processing):
Image_Processing.py

IN EACH .PY FILE, QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN DIVIDED TO DIFFERENT PARTS:
E.G.,
#####################################
# Question 1
#####################################


AND BRIEFLY EXPLAIN THE FUNCTION OF EACH PYTHON FILE:

# Python file: Text_Mining.py
#####################################
1.1 Tweets sentiment analysis.
1) Compute the possible sentiments of each tweet.
2) Compute the second most popular sentiment in the tweets.
3) Find the date with the most extremely positive tweets.

1.2 Tweets words analysis.
1) Compute total number of all words (including repetitions).
2) Compute total number of all distinct words.
3) Count words with no repetition.
4) The 10 most frequent words in the corpus.
After remove stop words and charater <= 2, recompute the result:
5) [Removed]Words count.
6) [Removed]Words count with no repetition.
7) [Removed]The 10 most frequent words.

1.3 Plot the line chart of words frequency([x - words][y - words frequencies]).

1.4 Apply Naive Bayes classifier for tweets.
1) Compute the error rate of classifier.
2) Compute the Error rate of MultinomialNB.

2.1 Avengers Image.
1) Determine the size of the avengers image.
2) Transform to grayscale and binary, then plot it.

2.2 Bush house Image:
1) Add Gaussian random noise.
2) Filter with Gaussian mask(sigma = 1).
3) Filter with uniform smoothing mask(size = 9).

2.3 Forestry Image with K-means segmentation then plot it.

2.4 Perform Canny edge detection and Hough Transform on rolland Image then plot it.
